# Ditto subprocessors

*Last updated:March 6, 2023*

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Ditto. We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

* [Render](https://render.com/security). Hosting provider.
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Payment processing services.
* [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/). Email services.
* [HoneyBadger](https://www.honeybadger.io/). Error tracking and downtime monitoring.
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). Cloud services provider.
