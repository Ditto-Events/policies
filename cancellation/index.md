# Cancellation policy

*Last updated: March 3, 2023*

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your payment directly in Ditto — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

Team administrators can follow these instructions to cancel their subscription in-app:
* Navigate to "Billing" from the menu (left side of the app) and select "Manage" in the "Subscriptions" section. You can then cancel your account in the Stripe portal. You can continue using your account until your paid period expires and your account is automatically canceled, or you can close it earlier after your subscription is stopped by reaching out to [support](mailto:support@ditto.events). 


Our legal responsibility is to team administrators, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the team admin is, [contact us](mailto:support@ditto.events). We will gladly reach out to any current team admins at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel an account?

You can cancel your subscription and keep using your account until your paid period expires. Then the account will be automatically canceled and will become inaccessible. You can also choose to cancel your account earlier.

We’ll permanently delete the content in your account from our servers 30 days after cancellation. So if you change your mind you’ll need to do it within the first 30 days after cancellation. **Content can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.**

We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle, [contact us](mailto:support@ditto.events) for a [fair refund](../refund/index.md). We’ll treat you right.

## Ditto-initiated cancellations

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period.

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](../terms/index.md). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](../abuse/index.md).
