# Who owns a Ditto team?

Ditto teams are owned by individuals, not by organizations. When you sign up and create a Ditto team, you are the administrator of that team and own all the data in it. Our legal responsibility is to the team admin(s), so we won’t let other people take over your team without your permission.

## What can team admins do?

Team administrators can:

- **Access all data in a team**: Team admins can access and manage Team and Billing information, Events, Tasks, Event Templates, Task Sets, and all other data related to that team.
- **Manage all aspects of the teams's subscription:** including updating billing information; adding more users and team administrators (if on a Team plan); and [canceling an account](mail_to:support@ditto.support). 
- **Designate other team admins**: Ditto teams that are subscribed to a Team plan can have multiple admins. We recommend designating other admins that you trust, so that updates can be made to the team when you're not available.

## Plans without multiple users

Teams that have a plan with only one user are treated the same way as multi-user teams. There is only one team admin and they manage that team and own all of its data. If you would like to add another admin, we recommend you upgrade to a multi-user plan.

## Designating other people as admins

A team admin can add or remove other admins from the Team Members section of Ditto. When you designate someone else as a team admin, they will have the same power to add and remove other admins (including you) at any time.

Adding a new admin to the account (or being removed as an admin) does not remove the credit card from the team. [Please contact support](mail_to:support@ditto.events) if you’d like to remove the card from the team before you add a new admin with the intent of being removed as an admin yourself.

If you are not on a multi-user plan, and you want to transfer ownership of a team to another admin, reach out to [support](mail_to:support@ditto.events) and we'll help you sort it out.

## What happens when none of the current team admins are available?

It happens — people switch jobs, get laid off, go on extended leave — the team admin(s) may be unavailable for any number of reasons. Still, our obligation is to the current team admins(s). That means we’re unable to add new admins to the account without permission from a current team admin, communicated from the email address we have on file.

The quickest route to add a new admin is often to contact a current team admin, and ask them to log in and add another team admin right away from the Team Members section of Ditto.

Otherwise, we can also gladly reach out to any current team administrator at the email addresses we have on file, and request permission to add an admin. If it’s a company address and another employee has access to the inbox, the person who receives the email can grant permission to add a new admin. For security’s sake, permission must come from an address we have on file for a current team admin.

When none of the above is an option, a court order is required to add another administrator to the team. We will of course readily comply with any court orders to turn data over to the appropriate party.

## What if I have another question about ownership?

Ditto may update this policy once in a blue moon — we’ll notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on our site. You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting Ditto [support][support-email].
